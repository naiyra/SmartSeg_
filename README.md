# SmartSeg – AI-Powered Customer Segmentation Engine

**SmartSeg** is a modular, AI-assisted customer segmentation platform built with .NET.  
It enables data-driven teams to upload datasets, clean and encode data, select relevant features, apply KMeans clustering, and generate human-readable insights — all in a fully decoupled architecture.

---

##  Key Features

- **Dataset Upload & Validation**  
  Uploads CSV datasets and validates format, types, and missing values.

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Handles nulls, cleans structural problems, fix duplicates, etc...

- **Feature Engineering and Selection**  
  Uses Feature engineering methods to identify the optimal features for the segmentation algorithm like normalizing formats, and appling label encoding for categorical features.

- **Optimal K Estimation**  
  Uses Elbow to recommend the best number of clusters.
  
- **KMeans Clustering Engine**  
  Applies Scikit-learn’s KMeans via Python integration to segment customers.

- **Readable Reporting**  
  - Converts numeric cluster outputs into readable summaries (e.g., “Budget-conscious females aged 25-34”).
  - It takes the clustered data and analyzes each cluster separately to find patterns and summaries.

## Contributors

This project is distributed across 4 developers:

| Developer | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| Dev A     | `DataHandling/` - Uploading, cleaning and preprocessing |
| Dev B     | `FeatureHandling/` - encoding and Feature selection/extraction |
| Dev C     | `MachineLearning/` - Clustering logic and optimal K |
| Dev D     | `Reporting/` - Interpreting and visualizing clusters |

- Each module = its own class + interface

- Only communicate through interfaces (IDataFrame, IClusterer, etc.)

- Define strict input/output contracts

- No module knows how the others work internally

1. Make sure you have [.NET 7+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed.
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/SmartSeg.git
   cd SmartSeg
3.before you start working make sure you understand these points: 
- Define Shared Interfaces for Each Stage: you should implement modules with clear interfaces (exp. Segmenter/ISegmenter.cs, FeatureHandling/IFeatureHandling.cs)
- Build a Class per Interface (exp. FeatureSelector.cs → implements IFeatureSelector)
