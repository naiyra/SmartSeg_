##  Key Features

- **Dataset Upload & Validation**  
  Uploads CSV datasets and validates format, types, and missing values.

- **Data Cleaning & Encoding**  
  Handles nulls, normalizes formats, and applies label encoding for categorical features.

- **AI-Assisted Feature Selection**  
  Uses OpenAI prompts to suggest optimal features for segmentation.

- **KMeans Clustering Engine**  
  Applies Scikit-learn’s KMeans via Python integration to segment customers.

- **Optimal K Estimation**  
  Uses Elbow and Silhouette methods to recommend the best number of clusters.

- **Readable Reporting**  
  Converts numeric cluster outputs into readable summaries (e.g., “Budget-conscious females aged 25-34”).
